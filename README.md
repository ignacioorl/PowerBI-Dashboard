# PowerBI-Dashboard

This project developed in PowerBI tried to have a more positive and realistic view of the actual progress in the World. In general, as this report suggests (https://www.gapminder.org/data/), people tend to misunderstand the actual progress. By looking at the below crucial aspects, we tried to show that, actually, we are improving (although much work still has to be done): 

1. Health
2. Education
3. Economy
4. Poverty
